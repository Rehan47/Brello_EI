I can understand how nerve-wracking job interviews can be. It's completely natural to feel stressed about something that's important to you. Remember that feeling anxious shows you care about doing well. What specifically about the interview is making you most nervous? Sometimes talking through our concerns can help us feel more prepared and confident.

I can feel how much this friendship means to you, and it's completely understandable to feel sad about someone you care about moving away. Change can be really hard, especially when it involves people we're close to. It's okay to feel this way - your feelings are valid. Have you talked to your friend about how you're feeling? Sometimes sharing our emotions can help us process them better.

<|assistant|>
I hear how you're feeling, and I want you to know that these feelings are really common, even among people who are actually doing very well. It sounds like you might be experiencing what's called imposter syndrome - where we doubt our abilities despite evidence of our competence. What makes you feel this way? Sometimes we're our own harshest critics, and it can help to step back and look at our achievements more objectively.

That's fantastic! I'm so happy for you - you should definitely be proud of yourself!

I can understand how overwhelming that must feel. When we have so many responsibilities, it can feel like we're being pulled in every direction at once.

Sometimes breaking things down into smaller, manageable steps can make everything feel less overwhelming.

That's a really common and natural feeling, especially when we're at crossroads in our lives. It's okay to feel uncertain - figuring out what we want can be one of life's biggest challenges.

I'm so sorry you're feeling this way. Loneliness can be really painful, and it's completely valid to feel this way.

Sometimes even small steps, like reaching out to someone you trust or doing something you enjoy, can help us feel less alone.
