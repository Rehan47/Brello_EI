# Brello EI 0 - Emotional Intelligence AI

**Created by Epic Systems | Engineered by Rehan Temkar**

A conversational AI model designed for emotional intelligence and empathetic responses. Brello EI 0 is part of the Brello AI family, bringing human-like emotional understanding to AI conversations.

## 🚀 Features

- **Emotional Intelligence**: Designed for empathetic, understanding responses
- **Conversational**: Natural dialogue flow and engagement
- **Local Operation**: Can run completely locally
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized for limited hardware
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for quick integration

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install torch transformers accelerate
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

```python
from brello_ei_0 import BrelloEI0

# Load the model
model = BrelloEI0(
    model_path="microsoft/DialoGPT-medium",
    load_in_4bit=False
)

# Generate emotionally intelligent response
response = model.generate_response("I'm feeling really stressed about my presentation tomorrow.")
print(response)
```

## 💬 Example Conversations

```python
# Anxiety Support
response = model.generate_response("I'm feeling really anxious about my job interview tomorrow.")
# Output: "I can understand how nerve-wracking job interviews can be..."

# Celebrating Success
response = model.generate_response("I just got promoted at work!")
# Output: "That's wonderful! I can feel your excitement..."

# Emotional Support
response = model.generate_response("I'm feeling lonely and isolated.")
# Output: "I'm so sorry you're feeling this way..."
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Emotional Support
- Providing empathetic responses to stress and anxiety
- Supporting users through difficult life transitions
